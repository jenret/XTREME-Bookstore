XTREME Bookstore web project

Case Study
Xtrme Learning is a group of book authors located in Utah. Recently the org has moved into retailing the books they publish and other authors in six different locations.  Xtrme Learning wants to be competitive in the market and wants to begin tracking all sales data from all six bookstores for a few months. Management has decided to develop a website to track the sales record of each bookstore on a daily basis. The analysis of the tracked-down data will give the management a fair idea of the performance of each bookstore

Whenever a book is purchased from any of the bookstores, the salesperson issues a cash memo to the customer. This cash memo contains details about the purchase. ISBN, author, publish date, edition, and purchase price. The salesperson should enter this information into a form and it stores in a data store. This data would then be analyzed at the end of the month to decide the performance of the bookstore. Because the cash memo is so important, it should be validated to be correct and have certain required fields entered or an error for the user should appear.

__Problem Statement__

Xtrme Learning needs to automate the process of analyzing the sales data of each bookstore to identify which location they will invest into for their growth plan.
